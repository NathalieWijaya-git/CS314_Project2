# CS314 Project 2: Boolean Satisfiability Solver
**Rutgers University - CS314**

## Project Overview
The program accepts a string representing a Boolean formula in **conjunctive normal form (CNF)**, a standard structure in mathematical logic and computer science. CNF consists of a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals, and a literal is either a variable or its negation. The program is executable in OCaml.
